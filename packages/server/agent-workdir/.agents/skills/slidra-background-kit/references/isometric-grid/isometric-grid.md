# isometric-grid

**Mood**: 30-degree isometric grid lines, like engineering isometric paper. Spatial but not busy.

**Suited for**: `dense`, especially pages about architecture or systems.
**Not suited for**: `anchor`.

**Suggested opacity**: 0.4

**Technique**: A diamond pattern: two sets of lines with opposite slopes interwoven.

Full SVG: see `isometric-grid.svg` in the same folder.

## Two alternative color schemes

Swapping the role assignments on the same image produces another color scheme — colors still all come from this deck's own palette, so nothing clashes with the style. When writing the asset, replace `var(--role)` with the **mapped** role color code; the SVG itself needs no changes.

| Scheme | Effect | Role mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | As-is, use the SVG below directly | — |
| `verdant` | Switch to tertiary-led. For most palettes, secondary_accent is a different hue family, which shifts the color temperature of the whole image. | `var(--primary)` → `secondary_accent` |
| `mono-ink` | Desaturate: everything uses text color and muted. The most restrained treatment, nearly just light and dark; suited for data pages and restrained styles. | `var(--primary)` → `muted` |

A deck uses **at most two color schemes** (typically `base` for content pages, the other for anchor pages); three or more make the whole deck look like a collage. Include the scheme in the asset name, e.g. `bg-<recipe>-<palette-code>-accent-led.svg`.

**Suggested styles**: 13, 04, 25.
