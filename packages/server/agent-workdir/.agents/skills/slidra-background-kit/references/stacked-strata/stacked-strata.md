# stacked-strata

**Mood**: Horizontal color bands that fade from bottom to top, like a geological cross-section. Stable, with a sense of accumulation.

**Suited for**: `anchor`, `breathing`.
**Not suited for**: `dense`.

**Suggested opacity**: 0.55

**Technique**: Five equal-height horizontal rectangles stacked bottom to top, with decreasing opacity.

Full SVG: see `stacked-strata.svg` in the same folder.

## Two alternative color schemes

Swapping the role assignments on the same image produces another color scheme — colors still all come from this deck's own palette, so nothing clashes with the style. When writing the asset, replace `var(--role)` with the **mapped** role color code; the SVG itself needs no changes.

| Scheme | Effect | Role mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | As-is, use the SVG below directly | — |
| `mono-ink` | Desaturate: everything uses text color and muted. The most restrained treatment, nearly just light and dark; suited for data pages and restrained styles. | `var(--primary)` → `muted` |
| `verdant` | Switch to tertiary-led. For most palettes, secondary_accent is a different hue family, which shifts the color temperature of the whole image. | `var(--primary)` → `secondary_accent` |

A deck uses **at most two color schemes** (typically `base` for content pages, the other for anchor pages); three or more make the whole deck look like a collage. Include the scheme in the asset name, e.g. `bg-<recipe>-<palette-code>-accent-led.svg`.

**Suggested styles**: 10, 12, 18, 24.
